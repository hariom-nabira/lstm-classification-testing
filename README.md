# 🔁 Understanding LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture designed to model temporal sequences and long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional RNNs.

## 🧠 What is LSTM?

LSTMs are specially designed neural networks capable of learning **long-term dependencies**. They are well-suited for problems where data is sequential — such as **time series forecasting**, **natural language processing**, and **speech recognition**.

Traditional RNNs suffer from vanishing and exploding gradient problems during training. LSTMs solve this by using **gates** to control the flow of information.

## 🔍 LSTM Architecture

An LSTM cell consists of the following components:

- **Forget Gate**: Decides what information to discard from the cell state.
- **Input Gate**: Decides what new information to store in the cell state.
- **Cell State**: Carries the long-term memory.
- **Output Gate**: Determines the next hidden state (output) based on the cell state.

Each LSTM cell uses the following equations:

```
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
c̃_t = tanh(W_c · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c)

c_t = f_t * c_{t-1} + i_t * c̃_t
h_t = o_t * tanh(c_t)
```

Where:
- `f_t`, `i_t`, `o_t`: forget, input, and output gates
- `c_t`: cell state at time t
- `h_t`: hidden state (output)
- `x_t`: input at time t
- `σ`: sigmoid activation
- `tanh`: hyperbolic tangent activation

## 🧰 LSTM in Keras (Python Example)

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

## 📚 Advantages of LSTM

- Handles long-term dependencies better than vanilla RNNs
- Capable of learning both short and long sequences
- Widely supported in modern deep learning frameworks

---

## ❗ Limitations

- Computationally intensive compared to simple RNNs
- Prone to overfitting on small datasets
- Requires more training data and time
